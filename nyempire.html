                Life in New York has driven Elizabeth Yanev into the ground — and she is delighted. Mrs. Yanev, 33, and her husband, Andrew, 34, were daunted by the price of two-bedroom apartments, and unimpressed with the selection. So Ross Evangelista, their agent with Stribling, offered an alternative: a roughly 1,800-square-foot duplex “studio” in a prewar co-op in Midtown East. It was the only apartment of its size they could afford below 135th street, but there was a hitch: The space was entirely below street level.
            </p>
            <p class="parfont">
                “I remember thinking, ‘Wow, this is incredible’ and ‘Oh, my gosh, what a complete wreck,’ ” Mrs. Yanev said of the apartment, where the upper level is partially below grade.
            </p>
            <p class="parfont">
                The unit was dark and had been vacant for several years because of a legal dispute with the previous owner that involved allegations of mold. But they saw potential: Walls of glass could be installed to bring in sunlight in the back, where the land slopes down; ceilings could be raised to 14 feet; and two private outdoor spaces, a terrace and a basement patio, offered a glimpse of suburban life.
            </p>
            <p class="fontst ftsty">
                They bought the apartment for $1.2 million in 2015 and spent more than a year renovating the space, which now includes a downstairs master bedroom, a nursery for their 11-month-old, Oscar, a guest room and a temperature-controlled wine closet. They declined to give the cost of the updates, but said it would not have been possible in a pricier aboveground apartment.
            </p>
            <p class="parfont">
                They are not alone. Both buyers and developers, typically preoccupied with skyward apartments, are reconsidering the lowly basement. As prices continue to decline in the luxury market, developers are keen on maximizing every square foot, including below-grade space, while buyers seek out bargains in a supply-heavy market. Developers are digging deeper for taller ceilings, installing full length windows and using clever sleight of hand — in the market for a photo studio? — to make the space appealing.
            </p>
            <p class="parfont">
                Buying a flight and hotel room together can often yield heftier savings. A quick search led me to a four-night stay in early December at the Winter Park Mountain Lodge west of Denver, just across the highway from the Winter Park Resort, for about $400 including nonstop airfare from Los Angeles. The price represents a $60 savings over booking flight and hotel separately.
            </p>
            <p class="parfont">
                It doesn’t always make up for the subterranean feel, but plenty of buyers are glad just to have the extra space.
            </p>
            <p class="parfont">
                In midsize projects where it doesn’t make sense to shoehorn amenities into the basement or rent the floor to retailers, developers can use that area as so-called “rec rooms” for ground-floor buyers. In some cases, full apartments are being placed below street level, where fancy finishes and tall windows help blur the distinction. (City zoning deems a property habitable when it is at least 50 percent above grade, and meets various safety requirements.) Because below-grade homes are typically cheaper than above-grade space, buyers can stretch their dollars, with some limitations, while developers make the most of their investment.
            </p>
            <p class="parfont">
                Some savvy buyers are willing to dive headlong into these deals. Jenna Basford, a 31-year-old real estate agent with Compass, paid $2.3 million for a ground-floor apartment with a lower level on the Upper West Side, based on floor plans alone.
            </p>
            <p class="parfont">
                “I’m just going on my gut,” said Ms. Basford, who was tipped off to the under-construction building at 350 West 71st Street by another broker. “We had no idea what it was even going to look like.”
            </p>
            <p class="parfont">
                While looking out at their yard, where they have begun growing a garden and plan to create a play space for their toddler, Mr. Yanev indulged another flight of fancy. “Maybe I’ll paint a mural,” he said, framing a spot on the brick wall directly outside their bedroom windows. Mrs. Yanev shot him a look. Not every idea born in the basement will see the light of day.
